# Bellamkonda Srividya — Portfolio (Ready)

This portfolio site has been personalized using the resume you provided. It is ready to push to GitHub.

Personalization made:
- Name, contact, education, internship, projects and links (LinkedIn/GitHub) populated from the provided resume.

Files of interest:
- `index.html` — homepage
- `resume.pdf` — your uploaded resume
- `projects/` — small runnable demo scripts and sample CSVs
- `images/profile.png` — profile photo (resized)

Push instructions:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Personalized portfolio: Bellamkonda Sri Vidya"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio_srividya.git
git push -u origin main
```

Notes:
- You should verify links (GitHub/LinkedIn) inside `index.html` and update them to your exact profiles if necessary.
- If you want additional changes (different phrasing, extra sections, notebooks), tell me what to add.
