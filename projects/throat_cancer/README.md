# Throat Cancer Prediction (Research Project)

This repository folder contains a compact, reproducible example of the throat cancer prediction pipeline described in the paper.

Files included:
- `sample_data.csv` — tiny synthetic sample data (demo only)
- `train_model.py` — minimal training script using RandomForest (run with `python train_model.py`)

Summary:
- Project uses ensemble learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy for early detection of throat cancer.
- Replace the sample CSV with the real dataset and add notebooks for EDA, preprocessing, and model comparison for full reproducibility.
