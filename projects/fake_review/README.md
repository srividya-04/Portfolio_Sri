# Fake Review Detection (Demo)

This folder contains a minimal reproducible text-classification pipeline to detect fraudulent reviews.

Files included:
- `sample_reviews.csv` — tiny demo dataset
- `train_text_model.py` — TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (run with `python train_text_model.py`)

Summary:
- Implemented feature extraction, training, and evaluation steps. For full project, add larger dataset, cross-validation, and saved model artifacts.
- Reported results include high detection accuracy on benchmarked folds (as described in the resume).
